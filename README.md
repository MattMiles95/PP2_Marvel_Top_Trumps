# Marvel Top Trumps

Marvel Top Trumps is a virtual card game featuring heroes and villains from Marvel Comics. Each card depicts a Marvel character with their own unique stats. These stats are rated from 1 - 10 across 5 different categories: Power, Agility, Intelligence, Fighting Skills and Battle IQ. Each round, once the cards have been dealt, the User must select which stat they want to play against their opponent. Whoever has the higher stat wins the round. Whilst the User can see what character their opponent is using each round, they cannot see their opponent's stats. The User must therefore rely on their knowledge of Marvel characters (or blind luck) to win each round.

Before starting the game, the User must choose which deck of cards they want to play with - the Hero Deck or the Villain Deck. Whichever they choose, the opposite deck will be used by their CPU opponent. The game is concluded when either the User or the opponent wins 7 rounds, or the User runs out of cards. The User starts each game with 14 cards.

The overall design of the game has been styled after classic comic books with a slight modern touch. This was achieved using a mix of bright colours and pop-art backgrounds to evoke a comic book aesthetic, contrasted with more modern design choices, such as glowing text and video-game themed Game Over menues.

The website essentially features two areas: the homepage, where the User selects their deck of cards, and the playing area (with slight design differences based on whether the User has chosen to play with the Hero or Villain Deck). Once the User has entered the playing area, they can use the 3 orange settings buttons to  navigate back to the homepage, open the 'How to Play' window for instructions on how to play the game, and toggle SFX on and off.
